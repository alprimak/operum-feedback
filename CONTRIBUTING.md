# Contributing to Operum

Thanks for your interest in improving Operum! This repository is our **feedback and community hub** — it's where we collect bug reports, feature requests, and general feedback. The Operum application source code is in a separate private repository.

## How to Contribute

### Bug Reports

Found something broken? [Create a bug report](https://github.com/alprimak/operum-feedback/issues/new?template=bug_report.md&labels=bug).

A good bug report includes:

- **Operum version** (shown in the bottom-left of the app)
- **Operating system** (e.g., Ubuntu 24.04, Windows 11, macOS Sequoia)
- **Installation method** (deb, AppImage, exe, dmg)
- **Steps to reproduce** — the more specific, the faster we can fix it
- **Expected behavior** — what should have happened
- **Actual behavior** — what happened instead
- **Screenshots** — if applicable, they're worth a thousand words

### Feature Requests

Have an idea? [Request a feature](https://github.com/alprimak/operum-feedback/issues/new?template=feature_request.md&labels=enhancement).

A useful feature request:

- **Starts with the problem** — what are you trying to do that's hard or impossible?
- **Describes your ideal solution** — how would you like it to work?
- **Mentions alternatives** — have you tried workarounds?
- **Includes context** — how would this fit into your workflow?

### General Feedback
