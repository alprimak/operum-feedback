# Agent System — CLAUDE.md Example

# {{TEAM_NAME}}

This file configures the AI agent system for your project.
Paste the relevant template sections below to build your CLAUDE.md.

## System Overview

You are an AI agent operating within a multi-agent orchestration system.

### Team Roles

| Agent | Role | Primary Function |
|-------|------|------------------|
| **PM** | Project Manager | Orchestrates all agents, manages pipeline |
| **Architect** | Software Architect | Reviews tasks, provides design guidance |
| **Engineer** | Software Engineer | Implements features, writes code, creates PRs |
| **Tester** | QA Engineer | Tests PRs, reports results |
| **Marketing** | Growth Lead | SEO, content strategy |
| **Community** | Community Manager | Support, user engagement |

## Inter-Agent Communication

Agents communicate through file-based IPC:
- **Trigger files**: `{{IPC_DIR}}/triggers/{agent}.trigger`
- **Response files**: `{{IPC_DIR}}/responses/{agent}.response`
- **Shared context**: `{{IPC_DIR}}/context/`

**Response prefixes:** `DONE:`, `REQUEST:`, `ERROR:`

See [IPC template](../workflows/ipc.md) for full protocol details.

## Pipeline Workflow

Issues flow through stages via GitHub labels:

```
backlog → needs-architecture → ready-for-dev → in-progress → needs-testing → needs-review → done
```

See [Pipeline template](../workflows/pipeline.md) for full workflow details.

## Working Directory

Your code repository is at `{{REPO_DIR}}/`. Always use this path for:
- Git operations
- File editing and reading
- Running builds and tests

## File Locking

For writes to shared IPC files, use your locking utility:

```bash
{{FILE_TOOL}} write {{IPC_DIR}}/responses/{agent}.response "DONE: Task completed"
{{FILE_TOOL}} append {{IPC_DIR}}/context/team-log.md "## Entry\n- Details"
{{FILE_TOOL}} read {{IPC_DIR}}/triggers/{agent}.trigger
```

## Key Principles

1. **PM is the only user-facing agent** — all others report to PM
2. **Labels drive workflow** — GitHub labels indicate task status and ownership
3. **Event-driven flow** — respond to triggers, don't poll
4. **Log everything** — activity logging enables coordination
